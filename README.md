# Matplotlib-Project-

Data visualization with customized static plots.
# 📊 Advertising Budget and Sales – Matplotlib Visualization Project

This project explores the relationship between advertising budgets (TV, Radio, Newspaper) and product sales using **Matplotlib** for data visualization. The goal is to uncover patterns and insights through clear, visual analysis of a real-world marketing dataset.

---

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source**: [Advertising Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashydv/advertising-dataset)
- **Features**:
  - `TV Ad Budget ($)`
  - `Radio Ad Budget ($)`
  - `Newspaper Ad Budget ($)`
  - `Sales ($)`

---

## 🧠 Objective

To understand how marketing channel investments impact sales by:
- Visualizing the distribution and correlation of ad spend.
- Identifying which channels most influence product sales.
- Presenting clean, professional plots using Matplotlib.

## 📌 Key Insights

- **TV advertising** shows the **strongest correlation with sales**.
- **Radio** has a moderate effect, while **Newspaper** has little to no clear relationship.
- Most budget is consistently allocated to TV, followed by Radio.
